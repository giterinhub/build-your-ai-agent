## Overview

![Tutorial header image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NucleusEngineering/serverless/main/.images/containers.jpg)

In this interactive tutorial, you will learn how to build and run containerized
AI agent written in Python and use automated build and deployment tools to release
to production in matter of minutes.

The tutorial is split into **3 modules**:

**Module 1** will explore Cloud Run, a compute platform for container workloads,
which you can use to easily run your services in a scalable, secure,
cost-effective and production-grade environment in a matter of minutes.

**Module 2** will explore Gemini's Function Calling feature. We will add new
 methods to fetch data from Firestore and manipulate your character 3D models a little bit.

**Module 3** will show you how to work with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). 
in Vertex AI with help of our Python SDK.

**Module 4** will let you showcase what you learned and make the Meow AI Agent create 
a 3D model based on your avatar! 

Hope you're not afraid to get your hands dirty. Make sure get a beverage and
some snacks of your choice, strap in and hit 'Start'.

## Module 1: Let's get the project running

![Tutorial header image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NucleusEngineering/serverless/main/.images/run.jpg)

In this module we will deploy this project with help of Terraform and Cloud Build. This will
give us a working URL where we can test our changes. 

[Overview on Cloud Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NucleusEngineering/serverless/main/.images/overview-run.png)

<walkthrough-tutorial-difficulty difficulty="2"></walkthrough-tutorial-difficulty>

Estimated time:
<walkthrough-tutorial-duration duration="30"></walkthrough-tutorial-duration>

To get started, click **Start**.

## Project setup

First, let's make sure we got the correct project selected. Go ahead and select
the provided project ID.

<walkthrough-project-setup billing="true"></walkthrough-project-setup>

<walkthrough-enable-apis apis="cloudbuild.googleapis.com,
run.googleapis.com,
aiplatform.googleapis.com,
firestore.googleapis.com,
artifactregistry.googleapis.com,
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com"></walkthrough-enable-apis>

You can use the builtin
<walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="menu-terminal-new-terminal"> Cloud
Shell Terminal </walkthrough-editor-spotlight> to run the gcloud command.

## Project preparation

Before we beging, there are some things we need to prepare, such as hydrate Firestore and upload 
some dummy documents for RAG.

```bash
gcloud config set project <walkthrough-project-id/>
gcloud config set run/region us-central1
gcloud config set artifacts/location us-central1
gcloud firestore databases create --location us-central1

gcloud storage buckets create gs://build-you-ai-agent-$(gcloud projects list --filter PROJECT_ID=<walkthrough-project-id/> --format="value(PROJECT_NUMBER)") --location=us-central1
gsutil cp -r data/* gs://build-you-ai-agent-$(gcloud projects list --filter PROJECT_ID=<walkthrough-project-id/> --format="value(PROJECT_NUMBER)")

gcloud firestore import gs://build-you-ai-agent-$(gcloud projects list --filter PROJECT_ID=<walkthrough-project-id/> --format="value(PROJECT_NUMBER)")/firestore-data --database="(default)"
```


## Exploring the code

Take some time and
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloudshell_open/build-your-ai-agent/app.py">
familiarize yourself with the code. </walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Once you've understood what's going on, you can try to run that app directly in
Cloud Shell, running the following in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PROJECT_ID=<walkthrough-project-id/>
export REGION=us-central1

python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --debugger --reload
```

This downloads dependencies, imports initial data to firestore and starts the web server. 
You can now use Cloud Shell Web Preview on port 8080 to check out your application. 
You can find the Web Preview <walkthrough-web-preview-icon></walkthrough-web-preview-icon> at
the top right in Cloud Shell. If you don't see a response from the web server,
try waiting a little longer for the python interpreter to start your server.

Try the AI Agent by asking it some things like "Show me my avatar" or "Show my character model" 
or even "What is Cloud Run?". You should get some valid responses in form of text or image or
a render viewport.

Finally, focus the terminal again and terminate the web server with `Ctrl-C`.

## Building and deploying the code

We established that our code runs locally, great! Let's put it on the cloud.

In the following steps, we'll deploy our app to Cloud Run, which is a compute
platform for running modern, cloud-first, containerized applications. Cloud Run
schedules and runs container images that expose services over HTTP. You can use
any programming language or framework, as long as you can bind an HTTP server on
a port provided by the `$PORT` environment variable. Please note that container
images must be in Docker or OCI format and will be run on Linux x86_64.

Cloud Run is available in all Google Cloud Platform regions globally. If you are
unsure where to deploy to, you can use the
[Region Picker](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/region-picker/) tool to find the
most suitable one. However make sure you select the region where Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3
and RAG Engine API are available, hence for this demo we suggest using us-central1.

You can configure your project and preferred regions and zones in `gcloud` so
its invocation becomes more convenient.

```bash
gcloud config set project <walkthrough-project-id/>
gcloud config set run/region us-central1
gcloud config set artifacts/location us-central1
```

First we need to setup all the bits and pieces for our service to work. For that we
use terraform that has already been configured to create a Cloud Run dummy service,
Artifact Registry and all the necessary permissions. Run the following commands to 
do just that:

```bash
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.template terraform.tfvars
edit terraform.tfvars # change the project_id (your project id) as well as the region (us-central1)
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Now with that out of the way, we need to focus on our code that is not yet built 
nor containerized, but Cloud Run requires that. The `gcloud` CLI has a convenient 
shortcut for deploying Cloud Run which quickly allows us to do so.

We can use a single command to easily:

- tarball a directory (build context)
- upload it to Cloud Build and use it to untar the context, build the app,
  containerize and store it on Artifact Registry
- create a new Cloud Run service with a fresh revision
- bind an IAM policy to the service
- route traffic to the new endpoint

```bash
gcloud run deploy build-your-ai-agent --source .
```

The command requires additional information and hence switches to an interactive
mode. You can have a look at the `gcloud` CLI
[reference](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy) in case
some of the options may be unclear to you.

We want our application to be publicly available on the internet, so we should
allow unauthenticated invocations from any client.

Wait for the deployment to finish and then navigate to the `*.a.run.app`
endpoint it created. You should be able to call the endpoint from your browser
or by using any other HTTP client like cURL.

Next, let's use `gcloud` to retrieve the auto-generated service URL and then
`curl` it:

```bash
gcloud run services describe build-your-ai-agent --format 'value(status.url)'
```

Now you can open this URL in your browser and hopefully see Meow AI Agent interface.

Cloud Run services consist of one or more revisions. Whenever you update your
service or its configuration, you are creating a new revision. Revisions are
immutable.

Navigate to the
[Cloud Run section in the Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)
to explore the service and its active revision.

Building from `--source` uses Google Cloud Buildpacks. Buildpacks are predefined
archetypes that take your application source code and transform it into
production-ready container images without any additional boilerplate (e.g. a
Dockerfile).
[Learn more about supported languages for Buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code).

## Using Cloud Code

Alternatively, you can deploy and otherwise manage the life cycle of your Cloud
Run services and other resources using Cloud Code. Cloud Code is an IDE plugin
for both VS Code and Intellj-based IDEs and is designed to make interaction with
Google Cloud more convenient.

Cloud Code is pre-installed in Cloud Shell.

Click the <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="activity-bar-cloud-code">
Cloud Code icon in the activity bar </walkthrough-editor-spotlight> to expand
it.

Within the activity bar
<walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="cloud-code-cloud-run-deploy"> you can
directly deploy to Cloud Run </walkthrough-editor-spotlight> too, without the
need to use the CLI.

Take a moment and familiarize yourself with the wizard. You can also use this
wizard to build and deploy directly to Cloud Run.

**Applications should be engineered to boot quickly.** Cloud Run can start your
containers very quickly, but it is your responsibility to bring up a web server
and you should engineer your code to do so quickly. The earlier this happens,
the earlier Cloud Run is able to route HTTP requests to the new instance, reduce
stress on the older instances and hence scale out effectively. Cloud Run
considers the life cycle stage from starting your application to the moment it
can serve HTTP requests as 'Startup'. During this time Cloud Run will
periodically check if your application has bound the port provided by `$PORT`
and if so, Cloud Run considers startup complete and routes live traffic to the
new instance. Depending on your application code, you can further cut down
startup time by enabling _Startup CPU boost_. When enabled, Cloud Run will
temporarily allocate additional CPU resources during startup of your
application.

**Applications should ideally be stateless.** Cloud Run will also automatically
scale in again, should application traffic decrease. Container instances will be
terminated, if Cloud Run determines that too many are active to deal with the
current request load. When an instance is scheduled for termination, Cloud Run
will change its life cycle stage to 'Shutdown'. You can trap the `SIGTERM`
signal in your code and begin a graceful shutdown of your instance. Requests
will no longer be routed to your container and your application has 10 seconds
to persist data over the network, flush caches or complete some other remaining
write operations.

**Applications are generally request-driven**. During the 'Startup' and
'Shutdown' stages of each container life cycle, your application can expect to
be able to fully use the allocated CPU. During the 'Serving' life cycle, the CPU
is only available when there is at least one active request being processed on a
container instance. If there is no active request on the instance, Cloud Run
will throttle the CPU and use it elsewhere. You will not be charged for CPU time
if it's throttled. Occasionally, you might create applications that require a
CPU to be always available, for instance when running background services. In
this scenario, you want to switch from Cloud Run's default _CPU allocated during
requests_ to the alternative mode _CPU always allocated_. Note that this will
also switch Cloud Run to a
[different pricing model](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing#tables). The
following diagram shows the two pricing models and their effect on how CPUs are
throttled throughout the life cycle of a container instance.

![Cloud Run container life cycle and CPU throttling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NucleusEngineering/serverless/main/.images/lifecycle.png)

Take a look at the deployment wizard for your service in the
[Cloud Run section in the Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/deploy/europe-north1/jokes)
and make sure **Startup CPU boost** is enabled.

While you are in the Google Cloud Console, have a look at
[the metrics section of your service](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/europe-north1/jokes/metrics)
and explore how the previously executed load test affected scaling.

## Summary

You now have a good feel for what it means to build and deploy your code to
Cloud Run.

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

This completes Module 1. You can now wait for the live session to resume or
continue by yourself and on-demand.

## Module 2: 

Let's add some new functionality to our AI Agent. Let's think how can we make our AI
Agent create us a new avatar. For that, we should invoke some image generation model like
Imagen 3 for example. Luckily, Vertex AI has an available endpoint for us to to use.

First we need to let our Gemini model know about this method. Open the <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloudshell_open/build-your-ai-agent/services/user.py">user.py</walkthrough-editor-open-file> and add a new definition
to to `get_function_declarations` method. Something like

```python
fc_generate_avatar = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="fc_generate_avatar",
    description='''Create new avatar or avatar.  
        Inject the description into the function that is being called.''',
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "description": {"type": "string", "description": "Description of the picture or avatar"},
        },
        "required": [
            "description",
        ]
    }
)
```

Also add this variable to the return statement:

```python
return [
    fc_generate_avatar, # this is the new entry
    fc_show_my_model,
    fc_show_my_avatar
]
```

With that out of the way, we need to implement the method now. You can use
the following snippet as a reference and modify it to your liking:

```python
def fc_generate_avatar(self, user_id, description):
    try:
        model = ImageGenerationModel.from_pretrained(self.config_service.get_property("general", "imagen_version"))

        instruction = self.config_service.get_property("chatbot", "diffusion_generation_instruction")

        images = model.generate_images(
            prompt=instruction % description,
            number_of_images=4,
            language="en",
            seed=100,
            add_watermark=False,
            aspect_ratio="1:1",
            safety_filter_level="block_some",
            person_generation="allow_adult",
        )

        output_file = "static/avatars/" + str(user_id) + ".png"
        images[0].save(location=output_file, include_generation_parameters=False)        

        cdn_url = '/' + output_file
    except Exception as e:
        logging.info("%s, %s", traceback.format_exc(), e)
        return 'Reply that we failed to generate a new avatar. Ask them to try again later'

    try:
        # Update Firestore "users" collection
        user_ref = self.db.collection("users").where(filter=FieldFilter("user_id", "==", user_id))
        user_ref.get()[0].reference.update({"avatar": cdn_url})
        logging.info('Updated user avatar to %s', cdn_url)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.info("%s, %s", traceback.format_exc(), e)
        return 'Reply that we failed to generate a new avatar. Ask them to try again later'

    return '''Reply that the avatar was successfully created.''', '''
        <div>
            <br>
            <img class="avatar" src="%s?rand=%s">
        </div>''' % (cdn_url, str(random.randint(0, 1000000)))
```

Now save the code and try asking our Meow AI Agent to create a new avatar by giving a description.
Something long the lines of "Create me a new avatar that is a cute, lowpoly, grey cat".

That was pretty neat, wasn't it? Now let's try something else... let's try making Gemini
change the color of our current 3D character. In this demo I have included a basic glb model
of a cat. You can see it by asking the agent to show you the model or character. Now, the rendering
and color changing functionality is already implemented on the frontend side, however it needs to be
called and instructed with which color to work. For that we need to create yet another "function" and 
instruct Gemini to call it. Same as previously, we add the reference:

```python
fc_save_model_color = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="fc_save_model_color",
    description="Save new color when user requests to update his game model. Input is a color in hex format",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "color": {"type": "string", "description": "Hex color"},
        },
        "required": [
            "color"
        ]
    }
)
```

and add it to the return of the `get_function_declarations` method:

```python
return [
    fc_generate_avatar,
    fc_save_model_color, # new return
    fc_show_my_model,
    fc_show_my_avatar
]
```

And lastly we need to implement the actual method. Here you have another sample implementation
that you are free to modify to your liking:

```python
def fc_save_model_color(self, user_id, color):
    try:
        # Get the models collection reference
        models_ref = self.db.collection("models")

        # Query for the model with the given user_id
        query = models_ref.where(filter=FieldFilter("user_id", "==", user_id))
        results = query.get()

        if not results:
            return f"Reply that no character for user '{user_id}' was found."

        # Update the color of the first matching document
        for doc in results:
            doc.reference.update({"color": color, "original_material": False})
            logging.info(f"Updated color to '{color}' for '{user_id}'\'s model.")
            break

        return '''Reply that their character color has been updated''', '''<script>window.reloadCurrentModel();</script>'''
    
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("%s, %s", traceback.format_exc(), e)
        return 'Reply that we failed to update their character settings.'

```

Save the code, ask the AI Agent to show your model and then ask it to change  the color to whatever
you like. Hopefully you will see the result on the screen right away!

Now you might be asking yourself, how are these methods invoked? How does the actual runtime 
calls the method that Gemini asks it to? Well, take a look at the implementatio in <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloudshell_open/build-your-ai-agent/services/function_calling.py">function_calling.py</walkthrough-editor-open-file>.
In a nutshell, gemini responds with a structured payload saying which method to call and with which
parameters. In python this is achieved via the following method:
```python 
return getattr(object, function)(**parameters)
```

## Summary

Now you should feel comfortable using our Vertex AI SDK for Python. You should be able
to create new functions that are invoked with Gemini.

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

This completes Module 2. You can now wait for the live session to resume or
continue by yourself and on-demand.

## Module 3: 

Now let's learn how to add Retrieval-augmented Generation to our AI Agent. We'll achieve
this by using the Vertex AI RAG Engine API - it is a component of 
the Vertex AI platform, which facilitates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG Engine 
enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to access and incorporate data from external knowledge 
sources, such as documents and databases. By using RAG, LLMs can generate more accurate and 
informative LLM responses. In this module we will add a document imaginary game called Cloud Meow. 
Document in question is <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloudshell_open/build-your-ai-agent/data/CloudMeow.pdf">CloudMeow.pdf</walkthrough-editor-open-file> - feel free to take a look :)

First step would be to set the correct path in <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloudshell_open/build-your-ai-agent/config.ini">config.ini</walkthrough-editor-open-file> by modifying YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER to the 
number of your project. To find your project number you can either go to Google Cloud Storage
in the console or use the following command in the open terminal:
```bash
gcloud projects list --filter PROJECT_ID=<walkthrough-project-id/> --format="value(PROJECT_NUMBER)"
```

Also please change `use_rag = false` to `use_rag = true`.

Next step would be to create a handler for RAG so it can be invoked by our main Gemini model.
Currently having function calling and RAG in the same instance is not possible hence the
need for two separate Gemini instances. The flow is as folows:
```
Request -> Gemini with Function Calling -> Function Call -> (Direct function execution || RAG model invocation) -> Output
```

Using Vertex AI RAG Engine involves just 3 steps:
1. Creating a corpus
2. Importing the files
3. Retrieving data from the Vertex RAG Store by specifying the corpus we created

As in the second module, we need to create a definition for our new method:
```python
fc_rag_retrieval = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="fc_rag_retrieval",
    description='''Function to be invoked when the prompt is 
        about a super secret game called Cloud Meow.''',
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "question_passthrough": {"type": "string", "description": "The whole user's prompt in the context of this message"}
        },
        "required": [
            "question_passthrough",
        ]            
    }
)

### rest of function declarations

return [
    fc_rag_retrieval, # new return
    fc_generate_avatar,
    fc_save_model_color,
    fc_show_my_model,
    fc_show_my_avatar
]
```

And the implementation of the actual method:

```python
def fc_rag_retrieval(self, user_id, question_passthrough):
    response = self.rag_model.generate_content(question_passthrough)
    return extract_text(response), ''
```

As you can see, the implementation is just a simple passthrough of the question to
another instance of Gemini that was created with RAG that the grounding via provided
PDF document that we specified in the config.ini.

Now you can ask the Meow AI Agent something unique to what is in that document, for
example "What's the visual style of Cloud Meow game?"

## Summary

Now you are fluent in using our RAG Engine API and should be able to incorporate data from
external knowledge sources, such as documents and databases.

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

This completes Module 3. You can now wait for the live session to resume or
continue by yourself and on-demand.

## Module 4: 

This module is more a free style module. I would like you to create a custom functionality
that responds to "Create me a 3D model / character from my avatar". Conviniently I have an
endpoint with a very fancy diffusion model that does just that. It's an API that allows you
to submit a job by providing an image in base64 format as part of JSON payload - 
({"image": "BASE64_IMAGE_DATA"}). The API will respond with a job_id that allows you to query
the second endpoint to see whether the generation task has finished or not. If the task has
completed, the response payload will have the link to the 3D model that you need to download 
and put into `static/models` folder as well as update the `model` field in  the `models` firestore
collection to something like `new-filename-that-is-job-id-uuid.glb`. If you manage to achieve
that then it means you have successfully completed our advanced challange!

## Summary

Hopefully you were successful in calling the external API provided to you and create a neat
3D model for your imaginary character!

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

This completes Module 4. You can now wait for the live session to resume or
continue by yourself and on-demand.
